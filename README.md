Created a webpage that:
- takes in any amount of numbers and adds them without the click of a button
- formats the answer to having commas
- prints out even if the number is even
- deleting the inputs will also change the answer
- a tracker to count how many numbers were inputted
- compares 2 arguments to see if they're both true in value and type
- takes the same 2 arguments and checks if the first argument is greater than or equal to the second argument
